q# Developer Module Enhancement Plan

## 🎯 Overview
**3 Essential Developer Tools** - Focused on system maintenance without exposing sensitive business data.

## 🔧 Core Features to Implement (3 Modules Only)

### 1. 🎨 3D Model Management
**Safe for developers - No business data exposure**
- **File Upload**: Support for GLTF, OBJ, and other 3D formats
- **Model Preview**: Real-time 3D preview before deployment
- **Active Model Selector**: Switch between different resort models
- **Model Metadata**: Basic info like file size, load times
- **Simple Version Control**: Track current vs previous model
- **Object Mapping**: Define clickable areas and names

### 2. � System Logs & Error Tracking
**Technical logs only - No business intelligence**
- **Error Log Viewer**: Application errors and exceptions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Page load times, API response times
- **System Health**: Server status, uptime monitoring
- **Technical Audit Trail**: Code deployments, system changes
- **Log Filtering**: Search by error type, time range, severity
- **Automated Cleanup**: Old log deletion (no business data retention)

### 3. � Maintenance & Cache Management
**System optimization - No data access**
- **Cache Control**: Clear application caches (not user data)
- **System Cleanup**: Temporary files, expired sessions
- **Performance Optimization**: Image compression, asset optimization
- **Feature Toggles**: Enable/disable non-critical features for maintenance
- **System Restart**: Safe application restart procedures
- **Health Checks**: Automated system status verification

## 📋 Implementation Priority

### ✅ Phase 1: 3D Model Manager (Essential)
- File upload interface for GLTF/OBJ models
- Model preview before deployment
- Switch active model for virtual tour

### ✅ Phase 2: System Logs (Important)
- Error tracking and monitoring
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Log filtering and search

### ✅ Phase 3: Maintenance Tools (Helpful)
- Cache management
- System cleanup utilities
- Basic health monitoring

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Considerations

### ❌ REMOVED for Security Reasons:
- **Database Administration** - Could expose customer data, bookings, payments
- **Environment Configuration** - Contains sensitive API keys, secrets
- **User Analytics** - Business intelligence that should stay with business roles
- **Advanced Audit Trails** - May contain confidential business operations

### ✅ SAFE for Developers:
- **3D Models** - Visual assets, no business data
- **System Logs** - Technical errors only, no user data
- **Cache Management** - System optimization, no data access

## 🎨 UI Structure (Simple 3-Tab Layout)

```

## 📈 Success Metrics
- **Faster Model Updates**: Easy GLTF deployment when resort changes
- **Better Error Tracking**: Quick identification of technical issues  
- **Improved Performance**: Regular cache cleanup and optimization
- **Reduced Downtime**: Proactive system health monitoring
