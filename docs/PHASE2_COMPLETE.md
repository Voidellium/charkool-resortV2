---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### **Adjust Retention Periods:**

Edit `app/api/cron/cleanup/route.js`:

```javascript
// Change system log retention from 5 to 7 days
logCutoffDate.setDate(logCutoffDate.getDate() - 7);

// Change audit trail retention from 90 to 120 days
auditCutoffDate.setDate(auditCutoffDate.getDate() - 120);

// Change OTP retention from 24 to 48 hours
otpCutoffDate.setHours(otpCutoffDate.getHours() - 48);
```

### **Add More File Types to Orphan Detection:**

Edit `app/api/developer/maintenance/clean-uploads/route.js`:

```javascript
// Add more database queries to get referenced files
const [payments, models, yourNewType] = await Promise.all([
  // ... existing queries
  prisma.yourModel.findMany({
    select: { filePath: true }
  })
]);
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Statistics Loading:** Cached for efficient loading
- **File Scanning:** May take time for large directories
- **Database Cleanup:** Uses batch deletion for efficiency
- **Cache Clearing:** Fast operation in most cases
- **Pagination:** Not needed as orphaned files shown in chunks
