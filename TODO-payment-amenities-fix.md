# Payment Status and Amenities Fix

## Issues to Fix:
1. Payment status not updating correctly for different payment types (half payment, reservation only)
2. Amenities not being captured properly based on payment type
3. Status showing as "paid" even for reservation only and half payment

## Plan Implementation:

### 1. Fix Payment Status Logic in Checkout Page ✅
- [x] Update `app/checkout/page.js` to properly set payment status based on payment type
- [x] Ensure reservation only sets status to 'pending'
- [x] Ensure half payment sets status to 'partial'
- [x] Ensure full payment sets status to 'paid'

### 2. Update Test Payment API ✅
- [x] Modify `app/api/payments/test/route.js` to handle different payment statuses
- [x] Add logic to capture amenities based on payment completion
- [x] Ensure booking status updates correctly

### 3. Enhance Booking API ✅
- [x] Update `app/api/bookings/route.js` to handle payment-type-specific amenity logic
- [x] Add proper status handling for different payment types

### 4. Update Confirmation Page ✅
- [x] Modify `app/confirmation/page.js` to display amenities based on payment status
- [x] Show appropriate amenities based on payment completion

## Testing Steps:
1. Test reservation only payment flow
2. Test half payment flow
3. Test full payment flow
4. Verify amenities are captured correctly for each type
5. Verify status updates correctly in all scenarios

## Summary of Changes Made:

### 1. Checkout Page (`app/checkout/page.js`)
- Updated payment status logic to properly differentiate between payment types:
  - Reservation only → `paymentStatus: 'pending'`, `bookingStatus: 'pending'`
  - Half payment → `paymentStatus: 'partial'`, `bookingStatus: 'confirmed'`
  - Full payment → `paymentStatus: 'paid'`, `bookingStatus: 'confirmed'`

### 2. Test Payment API (`app/api/payments/test/route.js`)
- Enhanced to handle different payment types and statuses
- Added proper booking status updates based on payment type
- Added logic to handle amenities based on payment completion

### 3. Booking API (`app/api/bookings/route.js`)
- Added payment-type-specific amenity handling logic
- Ensures amenities are properly associated with different payment statuses

### 4. Confirmation Page (`app/confirmation/page.js`)
- Added payment status and booking status display with color coding
- Shows appropriate amenity information based on payment completion
- Added informative messages for pending and partial payments

## Key Improvements:
- **Proper Status Management**: Each payment type now has its own distinct status
- **Amenity Handling**: Amenities are properly captured and displayed based on payment completion
- **User Feedback**: Clear visual indicators and messages inform users about their payment and amenity status
- **Consistent Logic**: All components now work together to provide a cohesive payment and amenity experience
