# Browser Fingerprinting & Session-Based OTP Implementation

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- [x] Added `TrustedBrowser` model to Prisma schema
- [x] Added relation to `User` model for trusted browsers
- [x] Generated and applied database migration

### 2. Browser Fingerprinting Utility
- [x] Created `src/lib/browser-fingerprint.js` with comprehensive fingerprinting
- [x] Implemented canvas-based fingerprinting
- [x] Added screen, navigator, and timezone data collection
- [x] Added incognito mode detection
- [x] Fixed syntax errors in the utility

### 3. API Endpoints
- [x] Created `/api/trusted-browsers` endpoint for managing trusted browsers
- [x] Created `/api/check-trusted-browser` endpoint for trust verification
- [x] Updated `/api/verify-session-otp` to mark browsers as trusted after OTP verification

### 4. Middleware Updates
- [x] Updated `middleware.ts` to use browser fingerprinting
- [x] Added `checkBrowserTrust` function to middleware
- [x] Implemented role-based OTP verification (excluding guest users)
- [x] Added browser fingerprint header checking

### 5. Client-Side Components
- [x] Created `BrowserFingerprintProvider` component
- [x] Updated root layout to include fingerprint provider
- [x] Updated OTP verification page to send browser fingerprint data
- [x] Added automatic browser registration for authenticated users

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Browser Fingerprinting**: When a user loads the app, the `BrowserFingerprintProvider` generates a unique fingerprint based on:
   - Canvas rendering patterns
   - Screen dimensions and color depth
   - Navigator properties (platform, cookies, hardware)
   - Timezone and language settings
   - User agent string

2. **Trust Check**: For role-based users (not guests), the middleware checks if the browser fingerprint is in the trusted browsers list:
   - If trusted ‚Üí Allow access
   - If not trusted ‚Üí Redirect to OTP verification

3. **OTP Verification**: When OTP is verified successfully:
   - Browser fingerprint is added to trusted browsers list
   - User can access protected areas
   - Future visits from the same browser won't require OTP

4. **Incognito Detection**: The system detects incognito/private mode and treats it as a new browser each time

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Test New Browser (Should require OTP)**:
   - Open the app in a new browser or incognito mode
   - Try to access a role-protected page (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`)
   - Should be redirected to OTP verification
   - After OTP verification, should be able to access the page

2. **Test Trusted Browser (Should not require OTP)**:
   - Use the same browser again
   - Access the same role-protected page
   - Should go directly to the page without OTP

3. **Test Different Browsers**:
   - Use Chrome ‚Üí Should require OTP first time
   - Use Firefox ‚Üí Should require OTP first time
   - Use same Chrome again ‚Üí Should not require OTP

## üîß Configuration

The system is configured to:
- Only apply to role-based accounts (superadmin, admin, receptionist, cashier, amenityinventorymanager)
- Skip OTP for guest users
- Automatically register browsers as trusted after successful OTP verification
- Update last used timestamp for trusted browsers

## üìù Notes

- Browser fingerprints are stored in the `TrustedBrowser` table
- Each user can have multiple trusted browsers
- Trusted browsers are soft-deleted (isActive = false) when removed
- The system gracefully handles errors and defaults to requiring OTP for security
